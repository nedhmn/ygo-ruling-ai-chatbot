Therefore, \"Pole Position\" is destroyed.EXAMPLE #7: I have \"Pole Position\", \"Banner of Courage\", and \"Opticlops\" face-up on the field. The opponent has \"Gemini Elf\" face-up on the field. When I enter my Battle Phase, an infinite loop is created as \"Opticlops\" fluctuates between 1800 and 2000 ATK.

In the second case, right before the monster is Special Summoned, you can activate the effect of \"Royal Oppression\" to negate the Special Summon (the same procedure that you use for \"Horn of Heaven\" or \"Solemn Judgment\").Example 1: If \"Marauding Captain\" is Normal Summoned, its effect activates. You can chain to this effect by activating the effect of \"Royal Oppression\". The effect of \"Marauding Captain\" is negated, no monster is Special Summoned, and the \"Marauding Captain\" is destroyed. (The monster your opponent intended to Special Summon with the effect of \"Marauding Captain\" remains in his hand.)Example 2: If \"Cyber Jar\" is Flip Summoned and its Flip Effect activates, you can activate the effect of \"Royal Oppression\" in a chain to the Flip Effect. The effect of \"Cyber Jar\" is negated, no monsters on the field are destroyed by its effect, no cards are picked up, no monsters are Special Summoned, and \"Cyber Jar\" is destroyed by the effect of \"Royal Oppression\".Example 3: If \"Call of the Haunted\" is activated, you can activate the effect of \"Royal Oppression\" in a chain.

    "content": "Q: Will \"Zombyra the Dark's\" attack decrease from the modified ATK caused by \"Adhesion Trap Hole\" (1050), or will it decrease from the original ATK (2100) and then the effect from \"Adhesion Trap Hole\" take effect each time it destroys a monster. i.e., \"Zombyra the Dark\" destroys a monster. Is its ATK now 850 or 950? A: \"Adhesion Trap Hole\" will only cause the original ATK of the monster to be halved. So in \"Zombyra the Dark's\" case, \"Adhesion Trap Hole\" will cause it to be at 1050 ATK after being summoned. Then, \"Zombyra the Dark's\" effect will cause it to lose 200 ATK points each time it destroys a monster. After destroying 1 monster, \"Zombyra the Dark's\" ATK value will be 850.
