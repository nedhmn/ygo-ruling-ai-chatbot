# Running the App

This document explains how to run the application using Docker Compose.

---

## Running the Application

1.  Open your terminal in the project's main directory.
2.  Run this command:

    ```bash copy
    docker compose up --build
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > The `--build` part is important the first time you run this, or after changing the setup.

## What Happens

When you run the command:

1. It sets up a data service (`seeder`) first.
2. Then it starts the main app (`web`).
3. The app will be ready at `http://localhost:3000`.

You'll see messages in your terminal as things are starting up.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `seeder` will only seed the database once.

## Success!

Congratulations! If everything went well, the application should now be running and accessible in your web browser.

Here's a quick look at what the running application should look like:
