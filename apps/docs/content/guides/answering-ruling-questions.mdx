## What is Goat Format?

This chatbot is specifically trained on the [Goat Format](https://www.goatformat.com/whatisgoat.html).

Goat Format is based on the summer 2005 Yu-Gi-Oh! era. The widely accepted card pool includes cards up to `The Lost Millennium (TLM)`, excluding `Exarion Universe` and `Cybernetic Revolution (CRV)`.

## Asking a Question

Once you have the application running, you'll see cards on the homepage. If you don't have an ongoing conversation, you can click on one of these cards to start asking a Goat Format question.

Here's an example of clicking a card to initiate a question:

After clicking, you can type your question about a Goat Format ruling into the chat interface.

> [!NOTE]

> For better and more detailed responses, you can edit the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable in `apps/web/.env.local` to use stronger models.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> As of `v1.0.0`, the chatbot is primarily trained on [individual card rulings](https://www.goatformat.com/indivrulings.html). We plan to expand its knowledge base in future updates.

## Getting Answers

The chatbot will process your question based on its training data and provide a ruling.
