## Key Features

- **Accurate Ruling Responses:** Provides precise answers for Yu-Gi-Oh! Goat Format rulings using a RAG approach.
- **AI-Powered Chatbot:** Combine AI reasoning and relevant context for comprehensive answers.
- **Dockerized Environment:** Ensures easy, consistent setup.
- **Turborepo Monorepo:** Efficiently manages project packages and applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** React framework for the chatbot.
- **Vercel AI SDK:** Integrates with AI models.
- **OpenAI:** Used for embeddings and AI models.
- **Pinecone:** Vector database for ruling embeddings.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS.
- **shadcn/ui:** Reusable UI components.
- **Turborepo:** Monorepo management.
- **ESLint & Prettier:** Code linting and formatting.
- **Cheerio:** Web scraping library for server-side jQuery.
- **Nextra:** Documentation framework.
- **Docker/docker-compose:** Containerization.
- **TypeScript:** For type safety.

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project uses RAG for accurate Yu-Gi-Oh! ruling answers. Instead of just using the AI's general knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant ruling info from Pinecone's vector database.

How it works:

1.  **Question Embedding:** User question is converted to an embedding using OpenAI.
2.  **Retrieval:** Embedding searches Pinecone for similar ruling embeddings.
3.  **Augmentation:** Retrieved ruling text provides context to the AI model.
4.  **Generation:** AI uses retrieved context and its reasoning to generate an accurate answer.

[Here's a fantastic blog](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/) about RAG and why it's used for more information.
