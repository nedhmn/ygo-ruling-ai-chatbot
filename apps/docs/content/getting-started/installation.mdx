# Installation

This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to get `ygo-ruling-ai-chatbot` set up on your local machine.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Docker:** You will need either [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (for Windows or macOS) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (for Linux).
- **Docker Compose:** This is typically installed alongside Docker Desktop or can be installed separately for Docker Engine ([installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)).
- **Git:** For cloning the bot's repository ([installation guide](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).

## Cloning the Repository

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can clone the `ygo-ruling-ai-chatbot` repository from GitHub.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project files.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nedhmn/ygo-ruling-ai-chatbot.git
    ```

4.  Navigate into the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd ygo-ruling-ai-chatbot
    ```

You have now successfully installed the prerequisites and obtained the project files. The next step is to configure the project with your OpenAI and Pinecone details, along with other settings.
